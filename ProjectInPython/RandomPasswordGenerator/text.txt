The error message you're encountering, "Pyperclip could not find a copy/paste mechanism for your system," indicates that Pyperclip is unable to determine the appropriate method for copying text to the clipboard on your system. Pyperclip relies on different mechanisms depending on the operating system, and it seems that it couldn't identify the correct method for your system.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

Install xclip (Linux Only):

If you're using Linux, Pyperclip may require the xclip package to work. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can use:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install xclip
After installing xclip, Pyperclip should be able to use it for clipboard operations.

Install Additional Clipboard Libraries (Windows Only):

If you're using Windows, Pyperclip relies on different clipboard mechanisms. Sometimes, it requires the pywin32 package. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pywin32
